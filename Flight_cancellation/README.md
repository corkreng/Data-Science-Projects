This Project was a combined final project of two different classes during my Master's.
The project was to be done in SAS enterprise miner and SAS programming with a three-person group.
It was a group project for which I was solely responsible for SAS programming. 
It included joins using different foreign keys, summary tables, data cleaning, and thorough analysis of variables
to determine if they should be included in the modeling process. 
I identified a strong class imbalance and created a modified sample which split the data into 50% 
canceled flights and %50 non-canceled flights and set the prior probability with SAS enterprise miner. 
I assisted Chloe in the modeling within SAS Enterprise Miner but most of the credit goes to her. 
The PowerPoint and written report was collaborative, but most of the credit goes to Will.


SAS and SQL code is included in the pdf file in the appendix.
