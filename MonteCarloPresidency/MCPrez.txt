Created simulated data of proportions for each state plus Washington D.C. using the 2024 election results.
Applied Monte Carlo simulations to create a distribution of electoral college votes. 

Two methods were applied. 
  The first method assumed independence among states.
      The underlying distributions for the Monte Carlo simulations were normal distributions. Given that the sample 
      sizes for proportions were greater than 30 justifies approximating the sampling distribution of the sample mean 
      as a normal distribution.

  The second method does not assume independence and uses past election proportions to create a covariance matrix.
      Similar to the first method but correlation among states is considered. Past elections data was used to create
      a covariance matrix before applying the monte carlo simulation.
