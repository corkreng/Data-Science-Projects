This project was originally done in my senior year of undergradaute studeies, but I wish to expand it to
include reinforcement learning.
After reading <https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf> page 11 
It specifically references the MiniMax algorithm in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. 
  " Although this is a simple problem, it cannot readily be solved in a satisfactory way through classical techniques.
  For example, the classical “minimax” solution from game theory is not correct here because it assumes a particular
  way of playing by the opponent."

If you play the MiniMax tic-tac-toe game you'll see that it works but still needs work. Funnily enough that is
how I found that particular book.
